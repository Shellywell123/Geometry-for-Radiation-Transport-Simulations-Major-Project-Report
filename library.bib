abstract = {One solution to the problem of shielding crew from particulate radiation in space is to use active electromagnetic shielding. Practical types of shield include the magnetic shield, in which a strong magnetic field diverts charged particles from the crew region, and the magnetic/electrostatic plasma shield, in which an electrostatic field shields the crew from positively charged particles, while a magnetic field confines electrons from the space plasma to provide charge neutrality. Advances in technology include high-strength composite materials, high temperature superconductors, numerical computational solutions to particle transport in electromagnetic fields, and a technology base for construction and operation of large superconducting magnets. These advances make electromagnetic shielding a practical alternative for near-term future missions.},

abstract = {Aluminium Oxide, Al2O3 is the most widely used material in the engineering applications. It is significant aluminium metal, because of its hardness and as a refractory material owing to its high melting point. This material has several engineering applications in diverse fields such as, ballistic armour systems, wear components, electrical and electronic substrates, automotive parts, components for electric industry and aero-engine. As well, it is used as a dosimeter for radiation protection and therapy applications for its optically stimulated luminescence properties. In this study, stopping powers and penetrating distances have been calculated for the alpha, proton, electron and gamma particles in space radiation shielding material Al2O3 for incident energies 1 keV-1 GeV using GEANT4 calculation code.},

To achieve this, track­ing par­ti­cles from source to the pa­tient de­liv­ery re­gion in a sin­gle sim­u­la­tion pro­vides a quan­ti­ta­tive de­scrip­tion that dis­tin­guishes the back­ground ra­di­a­tion from the treat­ment dose ar­riv­ing at the gantry's isocen­tre.

abstract = {G4beamline is a single-particle simulation program optimized for the design and evaluation of beam lines. It is based on the Geant4 toolkit [1], and can implement accurate and realistic simulations of particle transport in both EM fields and matter. This makes it particularly well suited for studies of muon collider and neutrino factory design concepts. G4beamline includes a rich repertoire of beamline elements and is intended to be used directly, without C++ programming, by accelerator physicists. The program has been enhanced to handle a large class of beamline and detector systems, and is available on Linux, Windows, and Macintosh platforms. {\textcopyright}2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Cherenkov radiation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature. It describes electromagnetic radiation from a charged particle moving in a medium with a uniform velocity larger than the phase velocity of light in the same medium. Such a picture is typically adopted in the investigation of traditional Cherenkov radiation as well as its counterparts in different branches of physics, including nonlinear optics, spintronics and plasmonics. In these cases, the radiation emitted spreads along a "cone", making it impractical for most applications. Here, we employ a self-accelerating optical pump wave-packet to demonstrate controlled shaping of one type of generalized Cherenkov radiation - dispersive waves in optical fibers. We show that, by tuning the parameters of the wave-packet, the emitted waves can be judiciously compressed and focused at desired locations, paving the way to such control in any physical system.},

This combination permits radiation and detector background simulations in accelerators where accurate tracking of all particles is required over long range or over many revolutions of a circular machine.},
